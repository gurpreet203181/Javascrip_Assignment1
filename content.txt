Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They are known for their intelligence, strong social bonds, and memory. These gentle giants have large ears that help regulate body temperature. Elephants use their trunks for communication, feeding, and drinking water. They primarily consume grass, fruits, and bark. African and Asian elephants are the two main species, with distinct physical differences. Due to habitat loss and poaching, their population is declining. Conservation efforts aim to protect elephants from extinction. These magnificent creatures play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.
